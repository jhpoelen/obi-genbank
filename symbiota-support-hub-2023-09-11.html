<p>Specimen from Natural History Collections are physical repositories
of genetic information. Genetic sequences extracted from specimen are
stored in genetic sequence databases like the openly accessible GenBank
at NCBI, DNA DataBank of Japan, or the European Nucleotide Archive
(ENA). While researchers and collection managers make efforts to
associate (or link) Natural History Collection records with their
derived genetic accession records, extra work is need to make these
associations explicit. We describe how a collaboration between a
biodiversity informatics expert and collection managers of the
Hoover/OBI Herbarium at CalPoly, San Luis Obispo, CA was forged with the
aim to extend OBI specimen records to include their associated GenBank
records. In addition, we quantify the costs of creating these specimen
extensions, and discuss the socio-economic capacity needed to repeat
this digital specimen extension process for the hundreds of millions of
specimen records available globally today.</p>

<p>Hello again Lindsay, Jenn, Katie,</p>
<p>Thinking about our Extended Specimen Workshop / OBI-GenBank
collaboration kept my poor little brain quite active today and
yesterday. In fact, I had trouble sleeping because of it.</p>
<p>As I am stewing on an abstract for your 2023-09-11 Symbiota Support
Hub session, I reflected on the effort it took for us to nurture our
collaboration:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>time investment to organize extended specimen workshop at Digital
Data 2023 at Tempe, AZ</p></li>
<li><p>time investment to package NCBI GenBank and OBI Herbarium digital
resources <span class="citation" data-cites="Poelen_2023_a Poelen_2023_b">(Poelen, Pearson, and Yost
2023; Poelen 2023)</span></p></li>
<li><p>time investment to build a custom (off-line enabled) workflow
based on (archived) digital resources of known origin</p></li>
<li><p>time investment to archive the NCBI GenBank Plant flat files at
ASU’s BioKIC via Globus facilitated by Greg Post and Nico Franz</p></li>
<li><p>time investment by Katie and Jorrit to collaborate on a shared
google sheets to propose (Jorrit) and verify (Katie) GenBank&lt;&gt;OBI
association claims</p></li>
<li><p>time investment by Katie to populate OBI’s Symbiota records with
associated GenBank sequences</p></li>
<li><p>transfer of symbolic reward (a tub of TJs Ginger Cookies) by
Symbiota developer Ed Gilbert at the July 2023 workshop on imagining a
Biological Action Center. This workshop itself required a 3 day time
investment on my part.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and now . . .</p>
<p>(pending)</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>More time investment (mostly by Jorrit) to publicize a novel
workflow to discover GenBank associations in existing natural history
collections as published through DwC-A.</li>
</ol>
<p>In an effort to do a little cost/benefit analysis, I made a quick
back-of-the-napkin calculation of the (socio-)economics aspects of our
experiment: I spent about 16 hours of work (I kept track of my time,
this excludes writing this text) and got a tub of 78 TJs Ginger Cookies
(13 servings at 6 cookies a serving). (Thank you!) Noting that the
resale value of TJ Ginger Cookies is probably about $1 or less, I favor
using cookies as a unit instead of a dollar. So, converting that to an
hourly effort would: 78 cookies / 16h ~ 5 cookies / hour. Another way
quantify the “value” of our method is to estimate the number of cookies
gained per created specimen GenBank association (as measured from
https://cch2.org/portal/content/dwca/OBI_DwC-A.zip with signature
hash://sha256/cd9de973510975dac3394952bba9c486a482762b3beab05ecb678037b99ab85b
as seen on 2023-07-19T14:46:11.145Z):</p>
<p>78 cookies / 25 GenBank associations = 3 cookies / OBI-GenBank
association</p>
<p>Assuming that someone is willing to work for 3 cookies per
association, and assuming that OBI is representative collection as far
as 0.03% of specimen (i.e., 94,031 OBI preserved specimen) having
GenBank associations (25 detected genbank associations), and estimating
about 200 million digitized preserved specimen (GBIF claims 225M,
iDigBio claims 138M as of 2023-08-10), you’d have to buy = 200M * 0.03%
* 3 = 60k associations * 3 cookies / association = 180k cookies or about
2300 tubs of TJs Ginger Cookies.</p>
<p>The case for making our method to efficiently produce/distribute the
number of cookies needed per GenBank association:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>monitor the availability of specimen-GenBank links in DwC-A and
GenBank (link out) over time</li>
<li>estimate time needed to discover new, and maintain existing,
specimen-GenBank links</li>
<li>produce re-usable methods, reducing development time</li>
<li>advertise the method to avoid rework</li>
<li>improve methods when needed through available means (standarization,
“smart” algorithms, efficient semi-automated link suggestion/curation
workflows)</li>
<li>express the value of having specimen-GenBank links readily/openly
available</li>
</ol>
<p>So, now my open questions are:</p>
<p><strong>Q1. How can we estimate the methods needed to support the
discovery and maintenance of Specimen-GenBank records such that it can
be sustained by those valueing the availability of Specimen-GenBank
records links?</strong></p>
<p>This is taking into account that one person cannot possibly eat 180k
cookies before they go stale, even if someone is willing (and able) to
source the 2300 cookie tubs needed to discover the specimen-genbank
claims. So, distribution of the cookies should be factored into the
development of the Specimen&lt;&gt;GenBank association discovery and
recording method.</p>
<p>As it stands, the work that Jorrit has done to showcase a method to
extend digital representations preserved specimen with their GenBank
associations is not yet valued in terms of “real” monetary units. Which
means that his work is, economically speaking, valueless.</p>
<p><strong>Q2. What is the value of Jorrit’s work so far? And who should
compensate him? What is 16 hours of my time worth to you? A $10 tub of
cookies?</strong></p>
<p>And, perhaps more importantly,</p>
<p><strong>Q3. do the current funding mechanisms allow for rapid
development of ideas to address immediate needs in the biodiversity
informatics community?</strong></p>
<p>I’d like very much to contribute to your support hub event, and
before doing so, I’d like to discuss the thoughts above. The reason for
taking on this prototype challenge was to gather some evidence to
support the idea that current funding mechanisms and project management
are insufficient to build something as dynamic and complex as the
digital extended specimen.</p>
<p>It make me think of a proverb I first encountered as a 6 year old,
and found inspirational only later in life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everybody want to go back to nature, but nobody wants to walk.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which can be reworded in terms of the digital extended specimen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Everybody wants to have the digital extended specimen, but someone
else has to build it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be a bit extreme of a statement in context of our
collaboration, especially because I know that you’ve invested plenty of
time in extending existing digital specimen with their GenBank sequences
and beyond.</p>
<p>In short, I’d like to have more discussion around effective
collaboration that help nurture, and sustain, the socio-economical
aspects of the digital extended specimen. Without these productive
collaborations, the massive amount of work needed to better integrate
the biodiversity / biology and informatics disciplines continues to be
as is - sporadic and mostly based on volunteer work. A similar, but more
broad argument, can be made for creating good working conditions to
promote quality research <span class="citation" data-cites="Rahal_2023">(Rahal et al. 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Curious to hear your thoughts,</p>
<p>thx, -jorrit</p>
